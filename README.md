I set out to create a project that would engage my friends and family, and the natural choice was to develop a game. Seeking a challenge beyond the simplicity of a tic-tac-toe-style game, I decided to reconnect with my video game roots by venturing into the realm of 2D-platformers. Thus, Ronny's Quest came to life. Through the implementation of particle animation, enemy collision, health tracking, and various other classic video game features, this project became a delightful and challenging endeavor. It not only laid a solid foundation in Python but also provided me with a captivating introduction to the world of video game creation.
