I wanted to develop a project that my friends and family would want to interact with and the immediate thought was to create a game. I wanted to challenge myself beyond a simple tic-tac-toe
style game and connect with my video game roots by creating a 2D-platformer. Thus Ronny's Quest was born. Implementing particle animation, enemy collision, health tracking, and many other classic video game
features, Ronny's Quest was a fun and challenging project that gave me a great foundation in Python and provided a great first-look into the world of video game creation.

### Quick Start

To start Ronny's Quest, download it from GitHub. In the command console, change directories to the Ronnys-Quest file. Ensure Python3 and pygame are installed and updated. Type "python3 main.py" into the console
and hit enter. If all proper packages are installed, Ronny's Quest should start.
